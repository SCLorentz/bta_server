# Minecraft BTA with friends

This is my own minecraft server on my favorite minecraft version, b1.7.3 with one of my favorite mods. I plan to use this to play with friends and nothing more. I like to have full control of what I'm doing (with a bit of perfectionism), so I will use this repo instead of the generic `shockbyte` server that my friends opt to use. But I still need to find a good host platform with support for docker deploy and a good pricing, maybe hostinger, idk. Maybe connect a matrix server inside the java server to create an virtual chat inside the game???

## Info and Waringing

The server of BTA is beeing modified to provide better control and optimizations for my usage intent. To open the original/modified server.jar file I'm using jd-cli-0.9.2 on graalvm. THE SOURCE CODE OF THE MODIFIED SERVER IS NOT AVALIABLE.

```fish
podman compose build
```

```fish
podman compose up -d
```
